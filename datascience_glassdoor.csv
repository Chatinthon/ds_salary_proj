Data Engineer,$93K-$152K (Glassdoor est.),"Job Description

Why consider OPI, and why do people dig working here?
Variety of consulting; new technologies, projects, and people on a regular basis.
Stability; we’ve been around since 1996 and have a diverse mix of clients and technologies to keep us busy, very busy. And we keep a bench. If you’re not on a project, you’re writing software for our internal business functions or you’re learning new technologies. It’s in our benefit to make our consultants as marketable as possible. That’s good for your career.
No politics or management; we don’t get in the way. Why sit in meetings all day when you can code and be productive?
Awesome benefits; free healthcare for your entire family (yes, free), 24 days of PTO + 10 days of sick time, quarterly profit sharing bonuses, you get paid OT, company trips (to Mexico), 3 company lake cabins/homes, various quarterly company events, new Macbook Pro’s, free beer/soda, chips, candy, and so much more.
You work with the best. Do an Object Partners search on LinkedIn and see the types of talent we hire. You truly get to work with intelligent, passionate engineers that share the same goal of building great software the right way.
Low company overhead. It all means more money back into our consultants pockets (profit sharing) or company trips and events to share in the financial success.

Qualifications

Architecture and design of highly available/scalable distributed systems.
Design and development of streaming data platforms using Kafka Streams, Spark, Flink, Storm, Beam or Cloud Dataflow.
Experience with functional/event-driven programming.
NoSQL technologies such as ElasticSearch or Cassandra.
Messaging technologies such as RabbitMQ, Kafka or Kinesis.
SQL on Hadoop technologies such as Hive, Impala or Presto.

Service frameworks such as Spring Boot, Ratpack, Vert.x, or Play.
Knowledge of data analytics, visualization and governance.
Knowledge of operating big data production solutions at scale.
Knowledge of CI/CD pipelines and DevOps culture.
Passion for software development. Someone that loves what they do, that aren’t just in it for a paycheck. Do you have dev projects going on at home at all times?
New projects, new teams, new technologies means having to adjust and learn all the time. You might get thrown on a DevOps project as well, so having the ability to jump in and get your feet wet without hesitation is important. If you don’t want to grow and learn, we’re not a fit.
Positive, can-do attitude. We can teach the technology, but we can’t teach how to approach client challenges with a positive, helpful demeanor. The best consultants aren’t the most technical (although that sure helps), it’s the consultant that will do whatever it takes to see a client be successful, no matter what they throw at you.",4.8,"Object Partners Inc

About the team:

The Study team strives to help learners meet their study goals across all of our supported platforms. This includes improving upon core product features, researching better ways to practice and master the content in Quizlet, and looking for ways to improve our study modes like the ML adaptive Learn mode. Our current projects include modernizing the Study modes with shared core logic using Kotlin Multiplatform, expanding the data model to support new user experiences, and rearchitecting the way we store our user-generated data to support massive scalability.
As a cross-functional team, we have engineers from Android, iOS, and Web working together with members from Product, Design, Data Science, Data Analytics, Product Support, and Marketing, to improve and develop new learning experiences. We also work closely with user research to understand how people use our product and what’s getting in their way to practice and master whatever they are learning.
One of our recent mobile projects has been improving our Flashcards study mode experience by updating the design of the feature to a more intuitive swiping flow that allows users to make piles for what they know and don’t know. We’re currently working on a big leap in grading user’s written answers to semantically interpret their input and give them feedback on how well they understand conceptually.


A breakdown of the average day in this role:

As a Senior Android Engineer, an average day likely starts by sharing your daily progress status with your team in Slack on what you accomplished yesterday, what you hope to accomplish today, and anything that is getting in your way or in the way of the team, then meet with team and huddle together to discuss progress towards our sprint goals around 10 AM PT.
At the beginning of the sprint, you’ll meet with the team to plan the sprint and discuss what goals the team can accomplish in the sprint and what will need to be done to accomplish them. Similarly, at the end of the sprint, you’ll meet for a team retrospective to discuss what has gone well and what could be improved in our sprint process.
Typically, the team aims to schedule meetings between 10 am and 2 pm, so that you have blocks of uninterrupted time in the morning and the afternoon to focus.
During the uninterrupted time, typically you get deep into coding and building the things you researched and estimated. You can also use that time to research a project and identify what will need to be groomed with the product manager, or what you questions you need to ask the designer, or how does the project need to be structured to work with our data along a data scientist, or what specific events will the data analyst need to answer our experiment hypothesis.
This research allows you to understand the product requirements and create Jira issues to later estimate with a larger group of Android engineers to ensure your approach is sound and others are familiar with your decisions, and ultimately to help you estimate the work so it can be later scheduled into a sprint. Once you code the feature and build the tests to ensure it works as designed, you create a pull request where you can help other engineers learn how you built the new feature or fixed a defect, and get feedback to grow as a developer.
Outside the team process and meetings, the Android team also meets biweekly and discusses upcoming projects and progress being made on the platform from the other teams with Android engineers.

The (quality) doctor is in.
Modio has streamlined the convoluted and messy process that is healthcare credentialing and saved countless years of manual and error-prone work in the process. As part of CHG Healthcare we are working to drastically improve the speed (and quality) of credentialing to ensure that our doctors can spend more time treating (millions) of patients each year and less time dealing with credentialing headaches.
Our industry is growing and demand is high. This means you’ll have plenty of opportunities to grow and develop in your career. Keeping healthcare healthy can be as fun as it is rewarding.
We are open to this role being in our offices in Salt Lake City, Utah or San Francisco, California.

Three database admins walked into a nosql bar. A little while later they walked out because they couldn’t find a table.

Automate the ingress/egress of data from the OneView platform.
Ensure that all the data in the OneView platform is high quality (and automate the process of identifying/fixing low quality/missing data).

You understand how to design software and systems that are maintainable, robust, easy to understand, and capable of scaling. You also know that not every solution needs to be over-engineered.
You should be able to debug technical issues, even if the issue isn’t from “your code” or “your system”.

5+ years’ experience working with production data. Must understand things like data normalization, relational databases, data cleansing, data sandboxing, data pipelines, BI/ETL tools, and a bunch of other stuff.
Strong proficiency writing SQL. Reading SQL is a plus.

We remain committed to putting our people, customers, and communities first and appreciate your patience and flexibility as we work through this.
The (quality) doctor is in.
Modio has streamlined the convoluted and messy process that is healthcare credentialing and saved countless years of manual and error-prone work in the process. As part of CHG Healthcare we are working to drastically improve the speed (and quality) of credentialing to ensure that our doctors can spend more time treating (millions) of patients each year and less time dealing with credentialing headaches.
Our industry is growing and demand is high. This means you’ll have plenty of opportunities to grow and develop in your career. Keeping healthcare healthy can be as fun as it is rewarding.
We are open to this role being in our offices in Salt Lake City, Utah or San Francisco, California.
Your role:
Three database admins walked into a nosql bar. A little while later they walked out because they couldn’t find a table.
On a more serious note, we are looking for a data engineer. This role spans many different technical disciplines, but the overarching goals are straightforward:
Automate the ingress/egress of data from the OneView platform.
Ensure that all the data in the OneView platform is high quality (and automate the process of identifying/fixing low quality/missing data).
In this role you’ll be doing a little bit of everything to accomplish these goals. Whether that means writing new API functionality to import data, setting up/maintaining automated data pipelines, or working on advanced reporting systems is up to you. Consider yourself the glue that makes all of our data accessible and “up to snuff.” This is a highly collaborative and highly visible role; complex systems are not developed in isolation!
A little about our tech stack:
AWS
CloudFormation/Terraform
Kubernetes/Istio
js/TypeScript
Pentaho Data Integration
MySQL/Aurora
If you’re an ambitious product-minded engineer who plays well with others AND can say yes to all of these statements, we are looking for you!
You are a doer. Whether you are coming up with projects that align with our vision or helping others do the same, you are doing it proactively.
You understand how to design software and systems that are maintainable, robust, easy to understand, and capable of scaling. You also know that not every solution needs to be over-engineered.
You should be able to debug technical issues, even if the issue isn’t from “your code” or “your system”.
Your qualifications:
5+ years’ experience working with production data. Must understand things like data normalization, relational databases, data cleansing, data sandboxing, data pipelines, BI/ETL tools, and a bunch of other stuff.
Strong proficiency writing SQL. Reading SQL is a plus.
Experience working with data integration like Pentaho (or similar).
Experience setting up and maintaining data pipelines.
Professional experience working on backend API code (Node.js/TypeScript Preferred but not a hard requirement). Familiarity with defensive coding practices preferred.
Experience working on a scrum team in an agile environment.
Experience mentoring junior engineers and performing code reviews.
(Preferred) BA/BS degree in computer science/software engineering.

About the Role


You'll be assuming ownership for our core algorithms and models. This means not only are you responsible for maintaining them, but we also expect you to propose radical improvements and suggest new areas for us to apply data science.

You'll be responsible for maintaining your own roadmap, with input from our product teams. But the roadmap is ultimately yours.

Your first week

You'll be given a crash course in how college admissions works. You'll meet the team and start working on one of the projects in our backlog. Finally, you'll start learning how our website works.

Your first month

You'll continue working through the project backlog. We also expect you'll be soaking up admissions knowledge, which means you'll start suggesting some project ideas of your own. We'll also make sure you've begun building relationships with our PMs.

Three months in

By this point you should be starting to shape your own roadmap and executing against it.

Six months in

A lot can happen in six months. During your first six months you've leveled up our core algorithms and have started exploring new ways data science can help CollegeVine's families and partners.

Benefits


We offer a competitive salary and a full suite of benefits, some of them unconventional, but awesome for the right person:
Medical, dental, vision insurance, and a 401k.
Flexible workday with a 4-hour core centered on EST - plan the rest of your workday as you wish, just give us the majority of your most creative hours.
Goal-based environment (as opposed to grind-based or decree-based environment; work smarter, not harder; intelligently, not mindlessly). We collaborate on setting goals, but you set your own process for accomplishing those goals. You will be entrusted with a lot of responsibility and you might even experience fulfillment and self-actualization as a result.
Join an engineering culture that celebrates mindfulness and takes the quality of your attention seriously.
Remember: Were a startup. Youre an early employee. We face challenges. We have to ship (a lot). Your ideas matter. You will make a difference.

Data Scientist,$82K-$141K (Glassdoor est.),"Common Networks was founded on the idea that everyone should have a choice for fast, affordable access to broadband internet. Right now, most homes in the U.S. don't. In fact, 62% of homes live in a monopoly broadband market. High-speed access unlocks all the superpowers on the internet. When it works, it can be a great leveling force across the world, giving everyone access to educational tools, entertainment, immediate translations, or even medical care that they wouldn’t otherwise have.

Common Networks provides suburban neighborhoods with internet using wireless technology. We interconnect homes in a neighborhood, creating a mesh network between homes and our fiber internet sources. A whole community can then have fast and reliable internet service with only a few locations needing fiber access.

As our first Data Scientist, you will own our entire data pipeline, from instrumentation and extraction to analytical presentations to the executive team. Building Internet infrastructure is expensive and our business model relies on leveraging data to find as many efficiencies as possible. To that end, you’ll work with Product to find creative ways to reduce hardware costs, with Growth to squeeze every last conversion out of our onboarding funnel, with Engineering to discern network-wide ramifications of minute changes to router kernel parameters, with Coverage to sketch out the best buildings to target when we launch new markets, and with Operations to identify process breaks before they show up in our top-level metrics.

The ideal candidate is passionate about democratizing our data and eager to wear many hats -- one day might entail installing Tableau and coaching stakeholders on best practices with the new BI tool, while another might involve changing our backend to emit that one metric that’s going to drastically simplify the analysis you’re trying to run. Our entire stack runs on GCP, with BigQuery as our data warehouse and all of our backend written in golang on Google’s Appengine -- bonus points if you come in with experience in those technologies, but we’d also be thrilled to invest in a great candidate that hasn’t worked with those exact products.
What you do
Build and maintain dashboards for core operational metrics (e.g. network reliability, growth funnel)
Own the methodologies behind how we measure ourselves and create new metrics as the business evolves
Clean and organize our data warehouse, manage scheduled aggregations, and expose rich views of data to stakeholders
Run your own investigations into our trickiest problems, finding approachable ways to present and visualize your findings to the rest of the company
Implement simple changes to our codebase when necessary -- you don’t let yourself get blocked on engineering
Chart out Common’s data roadmap, striking the right balance between quick-and-dirty analysis vs. building out robust, scalable data flows.
Requirements
BS with 5+ years of professional experience in a Data Scientist or Data Analyst role
Solid programming skills in at least one language in addition to excellent SQL skills
Experience working with and manipulating large, complex datasets.
Experience solving non-routine analysis problems, choosing the appropriate analytical methods and carrying the entire analysis from initial data gathering and requirements specification to final reporting and stakeholder presentation
Experience building, managing and organizing ETLs and data pipelinesExperience working with stakeholders to produce golden data datasets and clear views of common data needs
Excited to work in a startup environment on a small team; creative, resourceful, comfortable in a fast-moving environment. Excited to take on a wide range of responsibilities and cover many different roles loosely aligned around Data.
Demonstrated leadership and self-direction with a willingness to both teach others and learn new techniques.

Data Scientist,$131K-$207K (Glassdoor est.),"Who we are


The average public high school student in the US receives 38 minutes of guidance across 4 years. Here at CollegeVine, we're working to close the guidance gap by providing free, personalized guidance to all students. We've helped thousands of students get into college since 2013, and in 2019 pivoted to an all-digital guidance offering to expand our impact. Transitioning from one-on-one guidance to a 100% software offering is a big challenge, but we've been able to meet it thanks to our unique culture.

You'll be joining a distributed, talented team that's deeply invested in the problems we're trying to solve. We live all around the world, working from our homes, coffee shops, and even a boat! We recruit and hire from varied backgrounds based on our belief that our team's diversity allows us to create better solutions for families.

Who we're looking for


You know you're right for this position if:
You seek ownership beyond your own work, and look to the product and company as a whole.
You are a self-starter and internally motivated, with a strong desire to be part of a successful team that shares your high standards.
You understand what it means to be entrepreneurial and resourceful. Perhaps you've launched your own side-project, worked at a startup, or helped a scrappy business grow quickly.
Qualifications


In addition to your awesome attitude and values, we're looking for someone with the following skills:
Expertise with statistical software (i.e. R, Python, Julia, Matlab) and databases (SQL)
You're comfortable with git
At least a year's experience A/B testing
Excellent communication skills
It's an added bonus if you have:
An interest or curiosity around typed functional programming (we use Haskell & Purescript extensively)
Prior experience working with Rails, Django, or another MVC web framework
Worked remotely before
Gone through the US college admissions process, or can articulate how it works
About the Role


You'll be assuming ownership for our core algorithms and models. This means not only are you responsible for maintaining them, but we also expect you to propose radical improvements and suggest new areas for us to apply data science.

You'll be responsible for maintaining your own roadmap, with input from our product teams. But the roadmap is ultimately yours.

Your first week

You'll be given a crash course in how college admissions works. You'll meet the team and start working on one of the projects in our backlog. Finally, you'll start learning how our website works.

Your first month

You'll continue working through the project backlog. We also expect you'll be soaking up admissions knowledge, which means you'll start suggesting some project ideas of your own. We'll also make sure you've begun building relationships with our PMs.

Three months in

By this point you should be starting to shape your own roadmap and executing against it.

Six months in

A lot can happen in six months. During your first six months you've leveled up our core algorithms and have started exploring new ways data science can help CollegeVine's families and partners.

Benefits


We offer a competitive salary and a full suite of benefits, some of them unconventional, but awesome for the right person:
Medical, dental, vision insurance, and a 401k.
Flexible workday with a 4-hour core centered on EST - plan the rest of your workday as you wish, just give us the majority of your most creative hours.
Goal-based environment (as opposed to grind-based or decree-based environment; work smarter, not harder; intelligently, not mindlessly). We collaborate on setting goals, but you set your own process for accomplishing those goals. You will be entrusted with a lot of responsibility and you might even experience fulfillment and self-actualization as a result.
Join an engineering culture that celebrates mindfulness and takes the quality of your attention seriously.
Remember: Were a startup. Youre an early employee. We face challenges. We have to ship (a lot). Your ideas matter. You will make a difference.

This is a Telecommute/Work from Home position.

About Us VIDEO

Founded in 2013, Pivotal Software, Inc. combines our leading cloud-native platform, tools, and methodology to empower the world's largest organizations to adapt to change and build great software. Our technology unleashes developer productivity, while fulfilling our mission to transform how the world builds software.

You

As a data scientist on Pivotal's Data Science team, you'll be working on a wide variety of data problems for a diverse range of clients. You will often be asked to learn new technologies and domains on the fly. You should be comfortable working under deadlines and making tough decisions. Consequently, you will frequently have to balance achieving an immediate goal with scalability and productionalizability.

The role offers room for personal and professional growth, and you won't be working in isolation. Data Science at Pivotal is an encouraging and supportive team, where ideas and challenges are addressed collaboratively. We're looking for the kind of person who will try and solve a problem on their own first, but isn't afraid to ask for help or say ""I don't know.""

Us

The Data Science team at Pivotal is primarily a consulting practice; we are tool agnostic, working with our customers to solve real world problems. Our customers, like us, are cross-disciplinary. We service engagements with use cases running from customer churn to optimization to detecting fraud and misconduct. We are not just doers, we are also educators and enablers.

Your Day

While there is no such thing as a ""typical day"", these are activities we frequently find ourselves doing:
Working with clients to uncover and frame new opportunities for data science. Clients often come to us without a clear understanding of what we can do, so this is our chance to open their eyes to new possibilities for their businesses.
Exploring client datasets, looking for actionable insights we can present.
Engineering features, training models, tuning hyperparameters and evaluating the results. We emphasize rigor, because data science done right at this stage leads to models that shine in production.
Taking the models we build into production. This is an exciting stage for anyone who likes collaborating with engineering teams and seeing their model become real when users interact with it.
Helping our clients develop their internal data science practices, from hiring and recruiting to data capturing, so that they can be successful when we hand off the project.
Required Skills / Experiences
Clear and empathetic communicator. You'll be the one sharing your insights with clients and stakeholders at check-ins, documenting your work, and even explaining your model to client data teams as part of a handoff. As such, communication and empathy are essential parts of your toolkit.
Advanced knowledge of statistical modeling and/or machine learning methods. These are the tools we need to go from analysis to prediction.
Strong programming skills. Left to our own devices most of us work in Python, but learning the client's tech stack is an important part of the job.
Strong exploratory data analysis skills. Every engagement starts with an investigation of the data, and thorough EDA saves us a lot of headaches in the long run.
Some travel is expected, depending on location and skillset. We mostly work out of the Pivotal office closest to the client, but sometimes we have to be on site for an extended period of time.
At least a bachelor's degree in an analytical or technical field. This could be applied mathematics, statistics, computer science, operations research, economics, etc. Higher education welcome and encouraged.

This role will support US government clients that require US citizenship. Given this, US citizenship is required for you to apply.
Desired Skills / Experiences
2+ years of work in a data-centric field (data science or data engineering).
Experience with relational databases.
Exposure and experience working in a Linux environment.
You have a specialization in an area like NLP, optimization, or image processing.
Hands-on experience working in a distributed computing environment or proven theoretical understanding of parallelism.
Pivotal is an Equal Employment Opportunity employer that will consider all qualified applicants, regardless of race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, gender identity or expression, national origin, genetics, age, disability status, protected veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by applicable law.",4.5,"Pivotal

Data Scientist,$79K-$146K (Glassdoor est.),"Common Networks was founded on the idea that everyone should have a choice for fast, affordable access to broadband internet. Right now, most homes in the U.S. don't. In fact, 62% of homes live in a monopoly broadband market. High-speed access unlocks all the superpowers on the internet. When it works, it can be a great leveling force across the world, giving everyone access to educational tools, entertainment, immediate translations, or even medical care that they wouldn’t otherwise have.

Common Networks provides suburban neighborhoods with internet using wireless technology. We interconnect homes in a neighborhood, creating a mesh network between homes and our fiber internet sources. A whole community can then have fast and reliable internet service with only a few locations needing fiber access.

As our first Data Scientist, you will own our entire data pipeline, from instrumentation and extraction to analytical presentations to the executive team. Building Internet infrastructure is expensive and our business model relies on leveraging data to find as many efficiencies as possible. To that end, you’ll work with Product to find creative ways to reduce hardware costs, with Growth to squeeze every last conversion out of our onboarding funnel, with Engineering to discern network-wide ramifications of minute changes to router kernel parameters, with Coverage to sketch out the best buildings to target when we launch new markets, and with Operations to identify process breaks before they show up in our top-level metrics.

The ideal candidate is passionate about democratizing our data and eager to wear many hats -- one day might entail installing Tableau and coaching stakeholders on best practices with the new BI tool, while another might involve changing our backend to emit that one metric that’s going to drastically simplify the analysis you’re trying to run. Our entire stack runs on GCP, with BigQuery as our data warehouse and all of our backend written in golang on Google’s Appengine -- bonus points if you come in with experience in those technologies, but we’d also be thrilled to invest in a great candidate that hasn’t worked with those exact products.
What you do
Build and maintain dashboards for core operational metrics (e.g. network reliability, growth funnel)
Own the methodologies behind how we measure ourselves and create new metrics as the business evolves
Clean and organize our data warehouse, manage scheduled aggregations, and expose rich views of data to stakeholders
Run your own investigations into our trickiest problems, finding approachable ways to present and visualize your findings to the rest of the company
Implement simple changes to our codebase when necessary -- you don’t let yourself get blocked on engineering
Chart out Common’s data roadmap, striking the right balance between quick-and-dirty analysis vs. building out robust, scalable data flows.
Requirements
BS with 5+ years of professional experience in a Data Scientist or Data Analyst role
Solid programming skills in at least one language in addition to excellent SQL skills
Experience working with and manipulating large, complex datasets.
Experience solving non-routine analysis problems, choosing the appropriate analytical methods and carrying the entire analysis from initial data gathering and requirements specification to final reporting and stakeholder presentation
Experience building, managing and organizing ETLs and data pipelinesExperience working with stakeholders to produce golden data datasets and clear views of common data needs
Excited to work in a startup environment on a small team; creative, resourceful, comfortable in a fast-moving environment. Excited to take on a wide range of responsibilities and cover many different roles loosely aligned around Data.

The biggest blocker to delivering ML models in production is no longer the algorithms, but the data (or lack thereof) to train the models.

Before the dawn of everything internet, insurance was intimate and personal. You walked down the street to chat with your broker, and the risk to your business, your livelihood, was covered with a handshake. Today things are different. The average insurance policy for a mom-and-pop store trades through a dozen different hands and traverses a maze of systems and processes. Few are accountable and fewer know the whole story.

The roadmap of projects you’ll work on that tie directly to business goals and objectives.
Manage the entire lifecycle of data projects from strategic planning to tactical activities (data collection, cleanup, analysis, model implementation).
Sourcing new data for a firm that rarely scrapes, pulls or pushes.
Facilitate communication throughout the development process between executive stakeholders, your users and technical teams.
Coordinate and build strong working relations with various internal stakeholder groups, including IT, engineering, and legal.

The Data Science team at Pivotal is primarily a consulting practice; we are tool agnostic, working with our customers to solve real world problems. Our customers, like us, are cross-disciplinary. We service engagements with use cases running from customer churn to optimization to detecting fraud and misconduct. We are not just doers, we are also educators and enablers.

Your Day

While there is no such thing as a ""typical day"", these are activities we frequently find ourselves doing:
Working with clients to uncover and frame new opportunities for data science. Clients often come to us without a clear understanding of what we can do, so this is our chance to open their eyes to new possibilities for their businesses.
Exploring client datasets, looking for actionable insights we can present.
Engineering features, training models, tuning hyperparameters and evaluating the results. We emphasize rigor, because data science done right at this stage leads to models that shine in production.
Taking the models we build into production. This is an exciting stage for anyone who likes collaborating with engineering teams and seeing their model become real when users interact with it.
Helping our clients develop their internal data science practices, from hiring and recruiting to data capturing, so that they can be successful when we hand off the project.
Required Skills / Experiences
Clear and empathetic communicator. You'll be the one sharing your insights with clients and stakeholders at check-ins, documenting your work, and even explaining your model to client data teams as part of a handoff. As such, communication and empathy are essential parts of your toolkit.
Advanced knowledge of statistical modeling and/or machine learning methods. These are the tools we need to go from analysis to prediction.
Strong programming skills. Left to our own devices most of us work in Python, but learning the client's tech stack is an important part of the job.
Strong exploratory data analysis skills. Every engagement starts with an investigation of the data, and thorough EDA saves us a lot of headaches in the long run.
Some travel is expected, depending on location and skillset. We mostly work out of the Pivotal office closest to the client, but sometimes we have to be on site for an extended period of time.
At least a bachelor's degree in an analytical or technical field. This could be applied mathematics, statistics, computer science, operations research, economics, etc. Higher education welcome and encouraged.

This role will support US government clients that require US citizenship. Given this, US citizenship is required for you to apply.
Desired Skills / Experiences
2+ years of work in a data-centric field (data science or data engineering).
Experience with relational databases.
Exposure and experience working in a Linux environment.
You have a specialization in an area like NLP, optimization, or image processing.
Hands-on experience working in a distributed computing environment or proven theoretical understanding of parallelism.

Data Scientist,$45K-$97K (Glassdoor est.),"Common Networks was founded on the idea that everyone should have a choice for fast, affordable access to broadband internet. Right now, most homes in the U.S. don't. In fact, 62% of homes live in a monopoly broadband market. High-speed access unlocks all the superpowers on the internet. When it works, it can be a great leveling force across the world, giving everyone access to educational tools, entertainment, immediate translations, or even medical care that they wouldn’t otherwise have.

Common Networks provides suburban neighborhoods with internet using wireless technology. We interconnect homes in a neighborhood, creating a mesh network between homes and our fiber internet sources. A whole community can then have fast and reliable internet service with only a few locations needing fiber access.

As our first Data Scientist, you will own our entire data pipeline, from instrumentation and extraction to analytical presentations to the executive team. Building Internet infrastructure is expensive and our business model relies on leveraging data to find as many efficiencies as possible. To that end, you’ll work with Product to find creative ways to reduce hardware costs, with Growth to squeeze every last conversion out of our onboarding funnel, with Engineering to discern network-wide ramifications of minute changes to router kernel parameters, with Coverage to sketch out the best buildings to target when we launch new markets, and with Operations to identify process breaks before they show up in our top-level metrics.

The ideal candidate is passionate about democratizing our data and eager to wear many hats -- one day might entail installing Tableau and coaching stakeholders on best practices with the new BI tool, while another might involve changing our backend to emit that one metric that’s going to drastically simplify the analysis you’re trying to run. Our entire stack runs on GCP, with BigQuery as our data warehouse and all of our backend written in golang on Google’s Appengine -- bonus points if you come in with experience in those technologies, but we’d also be thrilled to invest in a great candidate that hasn’t worked with those exact products.
What you do
Build and maintain dashboards for core operational metrics (e.g. network reliability, growth funnel)
Own the methodologies behind how we measure ourselves and create new metrics as the business evolves
Clean and organize our data warehouse, manage scheduled aggregations, and expose rich views of data to stakeholders
Run your own investigations into our trickiest problems, finding approachable ways to present and visualize your findings to the rest of the company
Implement simple changes to our codebase when necessary -- you don’t let yourself get blocked on engineering
Chart out Common’s data roadmap, striking the right balance between quick-and-dirty analysis vs. building out robust, scalable data flows.
Requirements
BS with 5+ years of professional experience in a Data Scientist or Data Analyst role
Solid programming skills in at least one language in addition to excellent SQL skills
Experience working with and manipulating large, complex datasets.
Experience solving non-routine analysis problems, choosing the appropriate analytical methods and carrying the entire analysis from initial data gathering and requirements specification to final reporting and stakeholder presentation
Experience building, managing and organizing ETLs and data pipelinesExperience working with stakeholders to produce golden data datasets and clear views of common data needs
Excited to work in a startup environment on a small team; creative, resourceful, comfortable in a fast-moving environment. Excited to take on a wide range of responsibilities and cover many different roles loosely aligned around Data.
Demonstrated leadership and self-direction with a willingness to both teach others and learn new techniques.

Data Scientist,$71K-$117K (Glassdoor est.),"Watchful is a platform that makes machine teaching easy, scalable, and automated. The biggest blocker to delivering ML models in production is no longer the algorithms, but the data (or lack thereof) to train the models. Currently, this has been solved by scaling-out human annotators or labelers and there are a number of managed services that have risen to meet this need. However, for use cases that require specific context (intelligence, legal, cyber, etc.) and/or is based on sensitive or classified data, these solutions are untenable.

Watchful is a disruptive automated annotation platform that puts the power back in the hands of data scientists and subject matter experts to label orders of magnitude more data, in orders of magnitude less time.

Benefits Data Trust (BDT) seeks a Senior Researcher to develop and oversee BDT’s research agenda to investigate the impact of public benefits on people’s health, education, and economic well-being, and assess the effectiveness of different outreach and enrollment policies and practices.

Since 2005, BDT has screened more than one million households for eligibility in public benefits in cities and states across the nation. BDT’s core model of large-scale outreach and application assistance can be used to support randomized control trials (RCTs) to assess the effectiveness of different strategies to improve benefits access, and the impact of benefits on health, healthcare costs, economic mobility, and other outcomes.

The Senior Researcher will work closely with BDT staff from Data Science, Product, Projects, and other departments to develop BDT’s overall research agenda designed to increase impact, efficiency, and equity, and strengthen the evidence base for systems change. The Senior Researcher will build ongoing partnerships with external researchers and funders to identify joint research opportunities, conceptualize study designs, secure funding, and oversee the implementation of joint research and publication of key findings. The Senior Researcher will also work with staff across the organization to help prioritize and track internal research and evaluations consistent with BDT’s overall research agenda.

BDT has partnered with outside researchers in the past few years and is currently engaged in new investigations. For example, BDT conducted an RCT with the Abdul Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology involving 30,000 Medicaid participants in Pennsylvania, which found that BDT’s work tripled SNAP. BDT also co-led two other peer-reviewed studies involving more than 54,000 Medicare and Medicaid participants, which found that SNAP participation reduced the likelihood of nursing home admission by 23% and hospitalization by 14% in the year following enrollment.

Based in our Center City Philadelphia office, the Senior Researcher will report to the Director of Policy and supervise a Research Manager.

Due to COVID-19, BDT is operating under the Remote Working protocol, following federal CDC guidelines. While this job will begin as fully remote, we will eventually move back into our Centre Square office and at that time, all staff will be required to transition back into the office.

Responsibilities:

Before the dawn of everything internet, insurance was intimate and personal. You walked down the street to chat with your broker, and the risk to your business, your livelihood, was covered with a handshake. Today things are different. The average insurance policy for a mom-and-pop store trades through a dozen different hands and traverses a maze of systems and processes. Few are accountable and fewer know the whole story.

Some of the problems you will solve entail understanding data, identifying patterns, quantifying the impact of ML / NLP models and designing data visualizations. We seek a data scientist to help drive a new digital AI product team on a mission to unlock the potential of data and identify new opportunities.

As one of the founding members of a small, multi-disciplinary team of technologists, designers and product managers, you’ll have the freedom to make key product decisions without much oversight, and the tools and resources to build and ship ideas quickly. You’ll be a part of a startup-like environment, with the opportunity to have more control and leadership; in a company with thousands of existing customers.

Image recognition is no longer an innovation to you, instead it is a routine task.

You sail smooth in Python and always have sklearn, tensorflow, keras and pytorch on deck.
K-means more than a curt text and Logit and Probit are not Hobbit characters.
You have experience with relational databases such as PostgreSQL, Oracle or SQL Server, and maybe even Hadoop, Hive, Spark or Redshift.
You strive to learn the newest and greatest techniques where BERT/ELMo are not just Sesame Street© characters.
What you’ll own
The foundation for advanced analytics at a global company.
The roadmap of projects you’ll work on that tie directly to business goals and objectives.
Manage the entire lifecycle of data projects from strategic planning to tactical activities (data collection, cleanup, analysis, model implementation).
Sourcing new data for a firm that rarely scrapes, pulls or pushes.
Facilitate communication throughout the development process between executive stakeholders, your users and technical teams.
Coordinate and build strong working relations with various internal stakeholder groups, including IT, engineering, and legal.
Minimum Qualifications
Degree in computer science, engineering, mathematics, statistics, data science or a related technical field, or equivalent practical experience.
3 years of work experience in data science or related field.
Experience with statistical modeling using R, Python, or similar statistical languages.
